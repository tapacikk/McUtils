# One thing that's really tough with this stuff is figuring out how to manage shapes as we move across the different parsers and recursion level
#
# We can use the RegexPattern to manage the original StructuredType -> this seems to be pretty reliable
# We can use that to create an initial StructuredTypeArray -> this seems to be pretty reliable
# Then if we call parse_all, we need to reshape that StructuredTypeArray so that it can take a vector of return values
#     -> I _think_ this works as it should
# Next, no matter which parser we use, we need to get out our match or matches -> this is, again, quite reliable
# At that point we need to figure out how many groups each subarray should have -> this seems to be broken
#
#
# """
#
# """
# StringParser Design:
#
# input: RegexPattern
# output: StructuredTypeArray or list or OrderedDict thereof
#
# Basic Idea:
#
# RegexPattern can track which of its children are tagged as Capturing and which are tagged as Named. These children in turn
# can keep track of their data type (dtype) and also the shape of the data that should come out of their matched groups.
#
# So once we've compiled down RegexPattern--making sure that only groups at the outer-most level capture when compiling--
# what we can do is use the python re module to find the various matched components.
#
# At this point, we need to convert the matched strings into the appropriately formatted NumPy arrays. To handle this in
# recursive fashion I created a StructuredTypeArray class that has two flavors, simple and compound, which respectively
# handle the direct communication with NumPy and the delegation and distribution of higher-order data to simpler arrays.
#
# So in our parsing process we need to create a StructuredTypeArray for the found dtype from the RegexPattern. This is
# relatively straightforward. Next, we might be using parse_all which asks for a vector of results back. If this is the
# case we need to take our initial StructuredTypeArray and turn it into, in effect, a StructuredTypeArray vector. Rather
# than use an inefficient python list format, though, we call StructuredTypeArray.add_axis which broadcasts to a
# higher-dimensional data format. It also changes up the stored StructuredType such that a new axis has been prepended to
# the shapes of each.
#
# Next we have to work with our matched data somehow. There are a few issues here, but probably the biggest one is that the
# number of matched groups doesn't need to line up with the number of blocks we want returned. This means that we might need to take our
# matched groups and use some 'block_size' that each StructuredTypeArray tracks to figure out how to split these groups up.
#
# Assuming that works well, we now apply the block handler for each declared Capturing block to the matched data string.
# For very simple data, this will be effectively doing nothing, so that the StructuredTypeArray can handle the cast to an
# np.ndarray. For compound types or more complex data we need to basically go match-by-match and apply the block parser.
#
# This is where the recursion occurs and where things can get messy. The default block handler for an np.ndarray calls
# parse on a string. This means that parse will be called until the data can finally be put into a StructuredTypeArray
# format. On the other hand, the returned data needs to be consistent with the expected return type of the parent call.
# For that reason, the block handler passes in the return array, and the return array uses its stype when calling the
# subparser. This means, though, that there could be an apparent shape mismatch if the data itself is ragged. To resolve
# that, StructuredTypeArray will pad lower-dimensional data into a higher-dimensional format when possible.
#
# A major complicating factor in all of this is how one manages Repeating patterns. Every Repeating pattern actually needs
# to be managed using parse_all and its own Capturing groups, after first finding the matches for the repeats. Since the
# passed dtype for such a call is also a higher-dimensional object, the outer-most axis of the dtype needs to be dropped,
# then parse_all needs to be called on the child form. Managing this correctly inside a recursive process can be challenging.

        """Figures out how to handle the matched data from the parser
        In general the way we _want_ to do this is to basically do the most minimal amount of processing we can
        and then use the efficient methods inside StructuredTypeArray to cast this to properly typed arrays

        One issue is that we can end up with stuff that looks like:
            [
                [ group_a match_1, group_a match_2, group_b match_1, ... ]
                ...
            ]
        where we need to first chop the data into group_a, group_b, ...

        The type-calculus in RegexPattern and StructuredType can give us a "block size" for each subarray inside the
        StructuredTypeArray which indicates how many elements it expects to see from the group

        We use that to chop up the array as needed in these multi-match cases before trying to feed it into the
        StructuredTypeArray

        Complicating that, though, is that we sometimes need to do an extra layer of parsing on our matches

        Imagine that we found every instance of Repeating(Capturing(Number), suffix=Optional(Whitespace))

        This could give us something like
            [
                '-1232.123-234.345 3434.3434 10000000000',
                '5',
                '6'
            ]

        It would be hard to say what we should do with this, so we'll assume (possibly incorrectly) that we won't get a
        ragged array. If we need to introduce raggedness we'll do it later

        Even then, we could have
            [
                '-1232.123-234.345 3434.3434 10000000000',
                '5         5       5         5',
                '6         6       6         6'
            ]

        Here we'd need to go through line-by-line and apply the subparser of Number to each line to split it up

        On the other hand, what if we matched Duplicated(Capturing(Number), 4, riffle=Optional(Whitespace))?

        Then we'd have
            [
                ['-1232.123', '-234.345', '3434.3434', '10000000000'],
                ['5',         '5',        '5',         '5'],
                ['6',         '6',        '6',         '6']
            ]

        And here we wouldn't want to apply the subparser.

        The only way we could determine the difference is by comparing the shape of the StructuredTypeArray to the
        matched data. This means our block_handlers need to take the passed res array to figure their shit out too.
